# senior_thesis_2022
The files referenced in my senior thesis are all located in this directory as well as the data needed to run the notebook.

Script I: preprocessing_excel_data.py
Script II: plate_reader_analysis_EH_compilation.ipynb
Script III: amiga_preprocessing.py
Script IV: [AMiGA GitHub](https://github.com/firasmidani/amiga)
Script V: analyze.py and eh_expansion_v3.py
Script VI: first_look_AMiGA_graphical_numerical_improved_winter_2022.ipynb

Script Containing Helper Plotting Functions: utilities.py

The data folder contains all the information needed to be able to run the Jupyter Notebooks in Python.

The plots folder is empty, but both Script II and Script VI save their plots there if desired.
